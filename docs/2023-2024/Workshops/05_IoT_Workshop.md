**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">BASICS OF ARDUINO**</span>



Arduino programs are written in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Arduino IDE is a special software running on your system that allows you to write sketches (synonym for program in Arduino language) for different Arduino boards. The Arduino programming language is based on a very simple hardware programming language called processing, which is similar to the C language. After the sketch is written in the Arduino IDE, it should be uploaded on the Arduino board for execution.



The first step in programming the Arduino board is downloading and installing the Arduino IDE. The open-source Arduino IDE runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Download the Arduino software (depending on your OS) from the official website and follow the instructions to install.

****

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">STEPS TO WORK IN ARDUINO IDE:**</span>

Step 1 ‚àí Download Arduino IDE Software.

You can get different versions of Arduino IDE from the[ ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)[Download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on the Arduino Official website. 

Step 2 ‚àí Power up your board using standard USB cable

The Arduino Uno, Mega, Duemilanove and Arduino Nano automatically draw power from either the USB connection to the computer or an external power supply. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED (labeled PWR) should glow.Arduino needs 5V power supply.

Step 3 ‚àí Launch Arduino IDE.

After your Arduino IDE software is downloaded, you need to unzip the folder.

Inside the folder, you can find the application icon with an infinity label (application.exe). Double-click the icon to start the IDE.

Step 4 To create a new project, select File ‚Üí New.

![Enter image alt description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3xRoohoprktnzt6avewfnNF91JvkCuT/view?usp=sharing)

Step 6 ‚àí Select your Arduino board.

To avoid any error while uploading your program to the board, you must select the correct Arduino board name, which matches with the board connected to your computer.

Go to Tools ‚Üí Board and select your board.

![Enter image alt description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qw4n2-llcbRuiPsoX9mifOIzbjR-U8JS/view?usp=sharing)

Step 7 ‚àí Select your serial port.

Select the serial device of the Arduino board. Go to Tools ‚Üí Serial Port menu. This is likely to be COM3 or higher (COM1 and COM2 are usually reserved for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your Arduino board and reopen the menu, the entry that disappears should be of the Arduino board.

Reconnect the board and select that serial port.

**Step 8 ‚àí Upload the program to your board.** 

Before explaining how we can upload our program to the board, we must demonstrate the function of each symbol appearing in the Arduino IDE toolbar.

1. ‚àí Used to check if there is any compilation error.

2. ‚àí Used to upload a program to the Arduino board.

3. ‚àí Shortcut used to create a new sketch.

4. ‚àí Used to directly open one of the example sketch.

5. ‚àí Used to save your sketch.

6. ‚àí Serial monitor used to receive serial data from the board and send the serial data to the board.

Now, simply click the "Upload" button in the environment. Wait a few seconds; you will see the RX and TX LEDs on the board, flashing. If the upload is successful, the message "Done uploading" will appear in the status bar.

****

Once the installation is done you can start creating a blank program which is called as ‚Äòsketch‚Äô in Arduino. The structure of Arduino program is pretty simple. Arduino programs have a minimum of 2 blocks, Preparation and Execution block. Each block has a set of statements enclosed in curly braces:

```
void setup()
{
    statements-1;
    .
    .
    .
    statement-n;
} 

void loop()   
{ 
    statement-1;
    .
    .
    .
    statement-n;
}
```

Here, setup ( ) is the preparation block and loop ( ) is an execution block. The setup function is the first to execute when the program is executed, and this function is called only once. The setup function is used to initialize the pin modes and start serial communication. After the setup ( ) function is executed, the execution block runs next. The execution block hosts statements like reading inputs, triggering outputs, checking conditions etc. 

In the above example loop ( ) function is a part of execution block. As the name suggests, the loop( ) function executes the set of statements (enclosed in curly braces) repeatedly.

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">SPEED CONTROL OF SERVO MOTOR**</span>

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">WHAT IS SERVO MOTOR:**</span>

A servo motor  consists of a small electric motor, a potentiometer, control electronics, and a gearbox. The position of the output shaft is constantly measured by the internal potentiometer and compared with the target position set by the controller -Arduino. The gearbox decreases the speed of the motor, which increases the torque at the output shaft.  

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">SERVO MOTOR SPECIFICATIONS :**</span>

- Operating speed: 0.12second/ 60degree ( 4.8V no load)
- Stall Torque (4.8V): 17.5oz /in (1kg/cm)
- Operating voltage: 3.0V~7.2V
- Temperature range: -30 to +60
- Dead band width: 7usec

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">CONTROLLING A SERVO MOTOR:**</span>

Servo motors are controlled by sending a PWM (pulse-width modulation) signal to the signal line of the servo. The width of the pulses determines the position of the output shaft. When a signal with a pulse width of 1.5 milliseconds (ms)is sent , the servo will move to the neutral position (90 degrees). The min (0 degrees) and max (180 degrees) position typically correspond to a pulse width of 1 ms and 2 ms respectively.

Servo motor with Arduino example code. Position and sweep. More info: https://www.makerguides.com/ 

```
//Include the servo library:
include <Servo.h>

//Create a new servo object:
Servo myservo;

//Define the servo pin:
define servoPin 9

//Create a variable to store the servo position:
int angle = 0;
void setup() 
{
    //Attach the Servo variable to a pin:
    myservo.attach(servoPin);
}

void loop() 
{
    //Sweep from 0 to 180 degrees:
    for (angle = 0; angle <= 180; angle += 1) 
    {
        myservo.write(angle);
        delay(15);
    }

    //Delay after reaching 180 degrees
    delay(1000);

    //Sweep back from 180 to 0 degrees:
    for (angle = 180; angle >= 0; angle -= 1) 
    {
        myservo.write(angle);
        delay(15);
    }
    //Delay after reaching 0 degrees
delay(1000);
}
```

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">POSITION CONTROL OF SERVOMOTOR WITH POTENTIOMETER**</span>

In this example, we will use the potentiometer to control the servo motor position. The original idea is that when we change the potentiometer value, the Arduino will reference this value and drive the motor to the desired position.

OBSTACLE DETECTION USING ULTRASONIC SENSOR HC-SR04 BUZZER AND LED

**<span style="text - decoration: underline;">ULTRASONIC SENSOR HC-SR04 OVERVIEW:**</span>

The HC-SR04 is an affordable and easy to use distance measuring sensor which has a range from 2cm to 400cm (about an inch to 13 feet). The sensor is composed of two ultrasonic transducers. One is transmitter which outputs ultrasonic sound pulses and the other is receiver which listens for reflected waves. It‚Äôs basically a sonar which is used in submarines for detecting underwater objects.

![Enter image alt description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15tWnz8lCYACah3NQy7KN-wbPuj20Eddc/view?usp=sharing)

**Specification of HC-SR04:**

| Operating Voltage  | 5V DC  |
|---|---|
| Operating Current  | 15mA  |
| Operating Frequency  | 40KHz  |
| Min Range  | 2cm / 1 inch  |
| Max Range  | 400cm / 13 feet  |
| Accuracy  | 3mm  |
| Measuring Angle  | <15¬∞  |
| Dimension  | 45 x 20 x 15mm 
  |


**HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Pinout**

Here‚Äôs the pinout of the sensor:

The sensor has 4 pins. ***VCC*** and ***GND*** go to ***5V*** and ***GND*** pins on the Arduino, and the ***Trig*** and ***Echo*** go to any digital Arduino pin. Using the ***Trig*** pin we send the ultrasound wave from the transmitter, and with the ***Echo*** pin we listen for the reflected signal.
